    <h1>What Makes Us Different?</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>For many years, fashion design has been closely associated with tailoring, often considered the last resort after poor performance in school. 
    This is both wrong and unfortunate due to the fact that the international market of fashion is a thriving industry employing millions, adding value and greatly 
    propelling the economies of many nations.In Kenya, there are many aspiring and gifted designers with a passion for fashion and dreams to move from just tailoring 
    to become renowned fashion brands. <strong>Fashion App</strong> is an web application that helps many of these gifted designers to achieve their dreams in fashion
    by helping them get their briliant fashion ideas out to the world. Fashion App provides a platform where designers can create profiles and share some of their brilliant
    ideas. Fashion app also provides a platform for other users who may want to get new fashion design.There is great potential and genuine interest in fashion in East 
    Africa today, evidenced by the frequent occurrence of creative fashion events. Creativity alone without excellence will however perpetually keep us in a stagnant market. 
    It is upon this foundation that Fashion App is created.</p>
